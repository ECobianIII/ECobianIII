<h1> Hi, Im Eduardo ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2>Cybersecurity Projects ðŸ’»</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Security Audit:</b> Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Botium Toys' security controls and compliance framework, ensuring the implementation of critical data protection measures. Assessed adherence to relevant industry standards and provided actionable recommendations to mitigate potential risks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Security Management:</b> Utilized advanced SIEM platforms including <i>Splunk</i>, <i>LogRhythm</i>, and <i>Elastic SIEM</i> for the collection, analysis, and correlation of security events. Enhanced threat detection capabilities and ensured regulatory compliance by integrating best practices in security monitoring and incident response.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Local Network Design Schematic for a Small Office Environment:</b> Developed a comprehensive network blueprint illustrating both logical and physical layouts for a small office environment. This project provided foundational support for network infrastructure planning and clear communication of design choices to stakeholders.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>SOC Incident Analysis â€“ DNS Service Disruption:</b> Diagnosed and reported DNS server issues, including unreachable UDP port 53, using network analysis tools like tcpdump. Delivered actionable recommendations to restore functionality and prevent future disruptions, improving overall service uptime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Network Attack Analysis:</b> Identified, investigated, and mitigated network-based security threats. Enhanced network defense mechanisms and bolstered incident response strategies through a systematic approach to threat detection and mitigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Network Traffic Analysis with TCPdump:</b> Monitored and analyzed network traffic using tcpdump to identify potential security incidents. Provided insights and actionable recommendations to strengthen system protection and proactively address emerging threats.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Linux File Permissions & Access Control:</b> Configured and managed file permissions in Linux, applying best practices to enforce strict access control and enhance overall system security. Strengthened data protection by ensuring proper authorization protocols were in place.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>SQL for Security Analysis & Monitoring:</b> Developed and optimized SQL queries for security analysis and monitoring, leveraging data insights to identify anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and potential threats. Supported proactive threat detection strategies through database query refinement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data Leak Analysis & Mitigation:</b> Investigated an internal data exposure incident where an internal-only folder was mistakenly left accessible, leading to unauthorized sharing. Traced the breach, analyzed its impact, and implemented mitigation strategies to prevent future occurrences.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Intrusion Detection & Log Analysis with Suricata:</b> Performed an in-depth analysis of Suricata as an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS). Explored various detection rules and examined log outputs to understand how Suricata identifies and responds to network events.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DNS in Detail â€“ TryHackMe:</b> Explored the core functionalities of DNS, its crucial role in networking, and methodologies for extracting valuable information to support security investigations. Gained hands-on experience in DNS analysis and troubleshooting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Automating IP Allow List Updates: </b> access to restricted content is managed using an allow list of IP addresses stored in "allow_list.txt". To streamline the process of removing unauthorized IPs, I developed an algorithm that automatically updates this file based on a remove list.
  </li>
